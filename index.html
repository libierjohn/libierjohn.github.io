          <h3>Established 2019</h3>
          <p>Sunshine Tutoring Services was established in 2019 by Johnathan Libier, a University of Miami student with over half a decade of experience in tutoring. Johnathan wishes to provide students with an easy, personal, and affordable tutoring option in a time when tutoring services are becoming more and more impersonal. All clients are helped on an individual basis, with considerations taken for each client's unique situation.</p>
